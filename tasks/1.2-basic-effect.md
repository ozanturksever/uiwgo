### Step 1.2: Basic Effect

*   **Goal:** Create an `Effect` that runs once but doesn't yet react to changes.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Create `effect.go` in `pkg/reactivity`.
    2.  Define a global variable to hold the current `*effect` context.
    3.  Implement `CreateEffect(fn func())`. It should:
        *   Create an `effect` struct.
        *   Set the global context to this new effect.
        *   Run the provided function `fn` immediately.
        *   Clear the global context.
*   **Testing (`TestEffectInitialRun`):**
    *   Verify that the function passed to `CreateEffect` is executed once upon creation.
