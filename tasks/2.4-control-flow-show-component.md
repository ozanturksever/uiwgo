### Step 2.4: Control Flow - `Show` Component

*   **Goal:** Implement conditional rendering.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Implement `Show(props ShowProps) Node`.
    2.  The function will:
        *   Create a placeholder DOM node (e.g., a comment node).
        *   Create an effect that tracks `props.When`.
        *   Inside the effect:
            *   Run cleanup for the previous state.
            *   If `props.When.Get()` is true, render the `Children` and insert them into the DOM. Register a cleanup function to remove them.
            *   If false, do nothing (the cleanup has already removed them).
*   **Testing (Manual):**
    *   Create an example with a checkbox that toggles a signal.
    *   Use `Show` to conditionally display an element based on the checkbox's state.
    *   Verify the element appears and disappears correctly.
    *   Verify any `OnCleanup` hooks inside the `Show` component are fired.
