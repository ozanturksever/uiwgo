### Step 1.3: Wire Up Reactivity

*   **Goal:** Connect `Signal` and `Effect` to create a reactive data graph.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Modify `Signal.Get()`: If there is a current effect in the global context, add that effect to the signal's list of observers.
    2.  Modify `Signal.Set()`:
        *   If the new value is the same as the old value, do nothing.
        *   If the value changes, iterate over the signal's observers and call their `execute()` method.
*   **Testing (`TestReactivity`):**
    *   Create a signal and an effect that reads from it.
    *   Verify the effect runs initially.
    *   Call `Set()` on the signal with a new value and verify the effect runs again.
    *   Call `Set()` with the *same* value and verify the effect does *not* run again.
