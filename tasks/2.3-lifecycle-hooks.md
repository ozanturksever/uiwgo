### Step 2.3: Lifecycle Hooks

*   **Goal:** Implement `OnMount` and expose `OnCleanup`.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Implement `OnMount(fn func())`. For now, this can be a simple alias for `reactivity.CreateEffect`. A more robust solution that guarantees execution after DOM attachment can be implemented later.
    2.  Expose `reactivity.OnCleanup` by declaring `var OnCleanup = reactivity.OnCleanup`.
*   **Testing (Manual):**
    *   In the counter example, add an `OnMount` hook that prints a message to the console.
    *   Verify the message appears in the browser's developer console on page load.
