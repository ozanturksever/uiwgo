### Step 3.1: Documentation and Final Example

*   **Goal:** Clean up the code and provide a comprehensive example.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Add GoDoc comments to all public functions and types.
    2.  Create a `README.md` with build and run instructions.
    3.  Ensure the final `Counter` example in `examples/counter/main.go` is clean and demonstrates all major features (`Signal`, `Memo`, `Effect`, `OnMount`, `Text`).
