# Data Model: React Compatibility

## Entities

### ReactComponent
- **Description**: Represents a React component that can be rendered within the Go application.
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: A unique identifier for the component instance.
  - `name`: The name of the React component to be rendered (e.g., "DatePicker").
  - `props`: A map of properties to be passed to the React component.
- **Relationships**: None.

## State Transitions
- The state of a React component is managed by React itself.
- State changes are communicated to the Go application via callbacks.
- The Go application can update the props of a React component, which will trigger a re-render.
