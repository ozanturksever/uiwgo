# Feature Specification: Go Web Framework for Reactive Front-End Applications

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-go-project`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This Go project is a web framework for building reactive front-end applications in Go, compiled to WebAssembly. It features a declarative component model, fine-grained reactivity using signals, client-side routing, and direct DOM manipulation. The architecture emphasizes modularity and testability."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer uses the framework to build a single-page application (SPA) in Go that runs in the browser via WebAssembly. The application has interactive components that update automatically when the underlying data changes. The developer can manage complex application state in a central store, and components depending on that state update automatically. The developer can also define different pages and navigate between them without full page reloads. Furthermore, a developer can import an existing React component (e.g., a date picker) and use it within their Go application. The state of the React component (e.g., the selected date) can be synchronized with a Go-side signal.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Go component that displays a counter, **When** a user clicks a button to increment the counter, **Then** the displayed count updates instantly without a page reload.
2. **Given** an application with a home page and an about page, **When** the user clicks a link to the about page, **Then** the content of the about page is rendered, and the URL is updated, without a full page reload.
3. **Given** a component that fetches and displays user data from an API using a resource, **When** the component is rendered, **Then** it should initially display a loading indicator, followed by either the user's data or an error message.
4. **Given** a todo list application using a reactive store, **When** a user marks a todo item as complete, **Then** the application state is updated in the store, and all components displaying that item reactively update to show its completed status.
5. **Given** a Go application that uses a third-party React date picker component, **When** the user selects a date in the React component, **Then** a Go signal is updated with the new date, and other Go components depending on that signal are re-rendered.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a component's state is updated by multiple sources concurrently?
- How does the router handle invalid or non-existent routes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The framework MUST provide a mechanism to compile Go code to a WebAssembly module that can run in a web browser.
- **FR-002**: The framework MUST offer a declarative component model for building user interfaces.
- **FR-003**: The framework MUST implement a fine-grained reactivity system using signals for automatic state-driven UI updates.
- **FR-004**: The framework MUST include a client-side router to manage navigation between different views or pages within the application.
- **FR-005**: The framework MUST provide tools for direct and efficient manipulation of the browser's DOM from Go.
- **FR-006**: The framework's architecture MUST be modular to allow developers to use parts of the framework independently.
- **FR-007**: The framework MUST be designed to be testable, allowing for unit and integration tests of components and application logic.
- **FR-008**: The framework MUST provide a reactive store for managing complex, nested application state with fine-grained updates.
- **FR-009**: The framework MUST offer a "resource" primitive to manage asynchronous data fetching, tracking loading states, and handling errors reactively.
- **FR-010**: The framework MUST define and manage an application lifecycle, providing hooks for developers to execute code at specific lifecycle events.
- **FR-011**: The framework MUST provide automatic cleanup of reactive effects, event listeners, and other resources to prevent memory leaks.
- **FR-012**: The framework MUST include a fluent DOM element builder API for programmatically creating and manipulating the DOM in a readable way.
- **FR-013**: The framework MUST provide a compatibility layer to render and interact with third-party React components, allowing seamless integration with the Go-based reactivity system.
