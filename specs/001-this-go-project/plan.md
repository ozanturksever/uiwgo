# Implementation Plan: Go Web Framework with React Compatibility

**Branch**: `001-this-go-project` | **Date**: 2025-09-08 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-this-go-project/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The project is a Go-based web framework for building reactive front-end applications compiled to WebAssembly. This plan outlines the implementation of a React compatibility layer, which is the main unimplemented feature. The approach is to use a JavaScript bridge to render and manage React components, with state synchronized to the Go application's reactivity system.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go (latest stable)
**Primary Dependencies**: `syscall/js`, `honnef.co/go/js/dom/v2`
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: `go test`
**Target Platform**: WebAssembly (WASM)
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: Minimal overhead for Go-React communication.
**Constraints**: The solution must be compatible with the existing signal-based reactivity system.
**Scale/Scope**: The compatibility layer should support rendering multiple, independent React components.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes
- Libraries listed: `react-compat` - Provides React compatibility layer.
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.1.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? Yes

**Structure Decision**: Option 1

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - All unknowns have been resolved.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Research is complete.

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - `research.md` has been created.

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - `data-model.md` has been created.

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Contracts have been created in `contracts/react-compat.md`.

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - This will be done in the implementation phase.

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - `quickstart.md` has been created.

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - This will be done as part of the implementation.

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 10-15 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A       | N/A        | N/A                                 |
