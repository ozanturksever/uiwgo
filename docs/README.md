## Project Structure

This documentation follows a task-oriented approach designed for three main audiences:

1. **Application Developers** - Building SPAs and interactive pages with Go + WebAssembly
2. **Integrators** - Using React/shadcn/ui components within the Go runtime
3. **Contributors** - Extending the runtime and maintaining the codebase

## Quick Start

For the fastest path to a working example:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd uiwgo

# Run the counter example
make run counter

# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

See [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Key Features

- **Fine-grained Reactivity** - Signals, Effects, Memos with automatic dependency tracking
- **Gomponents-based Rendering** - Type-safe HTML generation with post-render binding
- **WebAssembly Target** - Go code running efficiently in the browser
- **React Compatibility** - Bridge for using React/shadcn/ui components
- **Client-side Routing** - Full navigation API with nested routes
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests and browser E2E testing patterns
- **Developer Experience** - Hot reload dev server and Make-based workflows

## Documentation Phases

This documentation is being delivered in phases:

- **Phase 1** âœ… - Foundations (Overview, Getting Started, Concepts, Core Guides)
- **Phase 2** ðŸš§ - Application Building (Advanced Guides, Router, Examples)
- **Phase 3** ðŸ“‹ - Ecosystem & Quality (React Compatibility, Performance, Testing)
